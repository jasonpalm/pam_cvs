This is a PAM module to authenticate Linux CVS against an Active Directory Server (ADS) using the ADS's
LDAP service.

To install this module:

1. Install CVS from source with PAM support. E.g.

	# a) (Make sure pam-devel and openldap-devel are installed on your system).
	
	# b) Get and install the latest 1.12.x release of cvs with PAM support. E.g.
	
	wget http://ftp.gnu.org/non-gnu/cvs/source/feature/1.12.13/cvs-1.12.13.tar.gz
	tar -xzf cvs-1.12.13.tar.gz
	cd cvs-1.12.13

	./configure --enable-pam
	make 
	sudo make install
	
2. Configure pam for CVS. Edit /etc/pam.d/cvs :

		#%PAM-1.0

		auth            sufficient      pam_cvs.so cvs_user cvsroot ldap_host ldap_port ads_domain
		account         sufficient      pam_cvs.so
		session         sufficient      pam_cvs.so
	
	# NOTE the arguments to pam_cvs.so in the auth section: 
	# a) the account CVS runs as, 
	# b) the absolute path to the CVSROOT directory of the repository
	# c) the LDAP host to authenticate against, and 
	# d) the LDAP port 
	# e) the Active Directory Server Domain. Will be automatically prepended to the supplied username
	     with a '\' separator.
	
3. Build and install the pam_cvs.so PAM module:

		make
		sudo make install
	
   If you want extra logging, define DEBUG when building:
	
		make CFLAGS=-DDEBUG
		sudo make install
	
4. Edit your repositories' CVSROOT/config files to include

	SystemAuth=yes
	
5. Ensure that the user that CVS runs as owns all repository files.
	
NOTES:

1) When authenticating, supply the username *without* the ADS domain. E.g.

	user.name
	

2) The module logs to syslog using AUTHPRIV. Check /var/log/secure (or the appropriate log for your system)
   for logging output.

3) Since CVS doesn't check the passwd file when authenticaing using PAM, and since you may not want 
   everyone in your LDAP directory to have access, the module checks the readers and writers files
   as the last step of authentication:
   
   - If neither file exists, all LDAP-authenticated users have access. 
   - If either or both files exist, the user has to be in at least one of them to complete authentication.
   - After a user has been authenticated, CVS still uses the readers and writers file (in the documented way) 
     to determine whether a user has write access to the repository.
